# Introduction

Dummy project to redirect visitors from the old website to the new one

# Getting Started

Configuration is in src/main/resources/application.properties

The app will run on port defined in the configuration file (default 8081).

This is built using Spring Boot, thymeleaf. We are creating a fully executable jar (see http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/deployment-install.html).

EditorConfig is used to enforce some minimally consistent coding styles, please install the appropriate plugin for your IDE if it's not supported out of the box.
